You can also check the live status from this link - [ https://geturweather.netlify.app/ ]

Firsly create your (index.html) file then copy-paste the code as like my file
Then crate (style.css) file and copy-paste

After that go to - (https://openweathermap.org/) and generate your API key by Logging In and then go to the option Current Weather Data (API doc) and copy the data which you want by city name or by latitude or longitude or whatever you want
Then create (script.js) file and copy-paste the code and don't forget to add you unique API key (Don't put mine, it will give error)

Also crate a file name (img) where you can paste all the images, icons and svg files.

Now it's almost ready, you have to save the file and run it into your local server or you can host your site in (https://www.netlify.com/)

Finally your project is done!
